# My-first-repository
This website has been built to showcase my technical skills and web design skills. This is my first repository that I will use to create my first website! My- first -repository contains my bio page and related files/ branches that would be used to publish my first website. It contains 6 branches but the main three branches for my bio page is the develop branch, feature/make-index-a-bio-page and final-iteration.
